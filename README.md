## Hi there 👋

Welcome to **HyperPS** — where security meets engineering.

This is my ✨ _special_ ✨ repository.  
Anything you see here is either breaking something (ethically) or fixing something (responsibly).

---

### 🔭 I’m currently working on
- Advanced security research (RCE, sandbox escapes, supply-chain issues)
- Android internals, stealth services, and system-level automation
- Fuzzers for media parsers (JPEG/WebP/etc.) and message preview engines
- High-integrity patches & security PRs for open-source ecosystems

### 🌱 I’m currently learning
- Deep-dive exploit chains (browser → kernel → sandbox)
- ML model security (tokenizers, ONNX, quantization pipelines)
- Scalable backend architectures for remote telemetry

### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
- Security research & vulnerability discovery
- High-performance tooling (Python/Rust/Go)
- Open-source patch contributions

### 🤔 I’m looking for help with
- Expanding fuzz coverage on message preview frameworks  
- More efficient input mutation strategies for media engines  
- Device-independent Android test harnesses

### 💬 Ask me about
- CVE processes, patch design, and disclosure strategy
- Android stealth/background services
- Fuzzing pipelines, crash triaging, PoC development
- AES/TCP client-server systems

### 📫 How to reach me
💬 GitHub Issues & Discussions are welcome

### 😄 Pronouns
He/Him

### ⚡ Fun fact
I break things so others can sleep peacefully 😄  
Also: my fuzzers have found more bugs at 3 AM than I have caffeine left.
